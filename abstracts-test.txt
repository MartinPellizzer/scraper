The post-viral acute cough (PAC) is a widespread symptom, mainly in childhood and adolescence, and is usually associated with an acute upper respiratory infection, namely the common cold. The use of cough relievers is, therefore, impressive, as documented by the market data. There are many medical devices and dietary supplements for treating PAC, which contain non-pharmacological components. Ancient people used traditional herbs to treat PAC. Thus, a well-established tradition considers natural remedies as an effective and safe way to relieve PAC. The herbal agents include polyphenols, flavonoids, saponins, glucosides, and alkaloids. Also, the European Medicine Agency has recognized the value of plant extracts and other natural substances to treat PAC. Nevertheless, a few studies investigated the role of non-pharmacologic remedies for PAC. There is some evidence for honey, glycerol, Althea officinalis, Drosera rotundifolia, Grindelia, Hedera helix, Pelargonium sidoides, Sambucus nigra, Thymus vulgaris, hyaluronic acid, and saline solutions. However, further rigorous studies should confirm natural products' efficacy and safety to relieve PAC.

Maekmoondong-tang (MMDT) is a traditional herbal medication widely used to improve cough in Korea, Japan, and China. It is composed of six herbs (Ophiopogonis Tuber, Pinelliae Tuber, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Zizyphi Fructus, Ginseng Radix, and Oryzae Semen).

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary-care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak and modest at best), and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have also been used as a treatment.

The mechanisms of actions of cough medicines are not always known. The problem is exacerbated for herbal medicines, where the effectiveness of the plant or its phytochemicals have rarely been carefully evaluated. Moreover, the most active phytomedicinal constituent is difficult to identify, and the expense and difficulty of such studies discourages sponsors who may not be able to benefit by subsequent exclusive marketing of the herbal remedy. Most popular herbs used as cough medicines appear to be demulcents whose action is confined to the oropharynx. It is probable that the vast majority of allegedly effective herbal cough medicines act as non-specific emetic-expectorants. The proof of activity of even marketed herbal derivatives such as guaifenesin and codeine is difficult to obtain. It is therefore likely that herbal cough medications will never be shown to be more active than placebos. Nevertheless, these plant products will continue to be popular remedies for patients and their health care advisors.

Context • Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), previously called postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS), has been considered universally to be one of the most common causes of chronic cough. As an important part of complementary and alternative therapy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has found an exact curative therapy for chronic cough through clinical practice for thousands of years. Objective • The aim of the current review was to investigate systematically the beneficial and adverse effects of Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) in the treatment of UACS. Design • The research team performed searches in 11 main databases from respective inception to October 31, 2015, supplemented with manual retrieval of other data. Only randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the effectiveness of CMH in patients with UACS were included. Descriptive and quantitative data on the studies' designs, population demographics, interventions, outcomes, and methodological quality were extracted and tabulated. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias system and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Participants • The reviewed studies included 1355 participants-720 in the CMH groups and 635 in the control groups-of both genders, from various professional and ethnic groups, and with a wide range of ages. They all had a duration of cough symptoms of longer than 8 wk and a clinical diagnosis of chronic cough induced by UACS that was supported by appropriate physical findings. Outcome Measures • The primary outcomes included (1) TCM recovery rate and (2) TCM cough symptom score. TCM's curative effect was calculated as the cumulative percentage of the symptom-score reduction (PSSR), estimated between baseline and postintervention. The cough symptom scores were graded according to the Chinese Criteria Guiding Principle of Clinical Research on New Drugs of TCM, with the scores being classified into 4 grades. Those scores ranged from 0-3 (ie, 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively), or 0-9 (ie, 0, 3, 6, 9, respectively), with the higher scores signifying a more frequent and severe cough. Results • A total of 16 studies that had been published in Chinese journals was ultimately identified for the review. The majority of methodological judgments demonstrated an unclear risk of bias. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model due to the poor homogeneity of the studies. Compared with Western medicine (WM), patients in both the CMH groups and the integrated therapy groups showed (1) a higher TCM recovery rate; (2) better relief of primary symptoms, including cough and postnasal dripping; (3) a reduction in physical signs, including the cobblestone appearance of the oropharyngeal mucosa or mucus in the oropharynx; and (4) a lower risk of cough relapse. No severe adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusions • CMH may be a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of UACS. The study highlighted the paucity of reliable clinical evidence for CMH and the need for RCTs of higher quality in the future.

About 80% of the population worldwide use a variety of traditional medicine, including herbal medicines, for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of illnesses, and for the improvement of general well-being. Total consumer spending on herbal dietary supplements in the United States reached an estimated $8.085 billion in 2017. In addition, the 8.5% increase in total sales from 2016 is the strongest growth for these products in more than 15 years. The main reason to use herbal products in these countries is the assumption of a better tolerability compared to synthetic drugs. Whereas in developing countries herbal medicines are mostly the only available and affordable treatment option. Surveys from industrialized countries reveal as main health areas in which herbal products are used for upper airway diseases including cough and common cold; other leading causes are gastrointestinal, nervous and urinary complaints up to painful conditions such as rheumatic diseases, joint pain and stiffness. Gastrointestinal disorders are the most widespread problems in health care. Many factors may upset the GI tract and its motility (or ability to keep moving), including: eating a diet low in fiber; lack of motion or sedentary lifestyle; frequent traveling or changes in daily routine; having excessive dairy products; anxiety and depression; resisting the urge to have a bowel movement habitually or due to pain of hemorrhoids; misuse of laxatives (stool softeners) that, over time, weaken the bowel muscles; calcium or aluminum antacids, antidepressants, iron pills, narcotics; pregnancy. About 30% to 40% of adults claim to have frequent indigestion, and over 50 million visits are made annually to ambulatory care facilities for symptoms related to the digestive system. Over ten million endoscopies and surgical procedures involving the GI tract are performed each year. Community-based studies from around the world demonstrate that 10% to 46% of all children meet the criteria for RAP. Gastrointestinal disorders such as chronic or acute diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal pain, and inflammatory bowel diseases can indicate immune deficiency, present in 5% to 50% of patients with primary immunodeficiencies. The gastrointestinal tract is the largest lymphoid organ in the body, so it is not surprising that intestinal diseases are common among immunodeficient patients. Gastroenterologists therefore must be able to diagnose and treat patients with primary immunodeficiency. Further, pathogens do influence the gut function. On the other hand, dietary habits and specific food types can play a significant role in the onset, treatment, and prevention of many GI disorders. Many of these can be prevented or minimized by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and practicing good bowel habits.

Cough is one of the most common medical symptoms for which medical advice is sought. Although cough is a protective reflex responsible for clearing the airways from secretions and foreign bodies, it can be a troublesome symptom that causes discomfort to patients. Due to the increasing interest in herbal remedies in both developed and developing countries, in the current study, we aimed to overview medicinal herbs containing essential oils used as antitussive agents according to Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) textbooks. We summarized the relevant scientific evidence on their possible pharmacological effects.

Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has grown to a worldwide pandemic with substantial mortality. The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, to life threatening complications. There are still quite a number of patients with COVID-19 showed enteric symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The gastrointestinal tract may be one of the target organs of SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is significantly expressed in intestinal cells. ACE2 links amino acid malnutrition to microbial ecology and intestinal inflammation. Intestinal flora imbalance and endotoxemia may accelerate the progression of COVID-19. Many herbs have demonstrated properties relevant to the treatment of COVID-19, by supporting organs and systems of the body affected by the virus. Herbs can restore the structure of the intestinal flora, which may further modulate the immune function after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regulation of intestinal flora by herbal medicine may be helpful for the treatment and recovery of the disease. Understanding the role of herbs that regulate intestinal flora in fighting respiratory virus infections and maintaining intestinal flora balance can provide new ideas for preventing and treating COVID-19.

The Hajong people use many medicinal plants in their different rituals. The information generated from the present study regarding the medico-religious plants used by the Hajong tribes need a thorough phytochemical investigation. This could help in creating awareness regarding the need for conservation of such plants and also in the promotion of ethno-medico-botany knowledge within the region besides contributing to the preservation and enrich- ment of the gene bank of such economically important species before they are lost forever. Medico-religious plants so found out in this study should be screened for their efficacy by which new drugs or products could be brought out. There is also need to document this information and compare with that of other tribes in the state and region.

Chronic cough is a significant health burden. Patients experience variable benefits from over the counter and prescribed products, but there is an unmet need to provide more effective treatments. Natural products have been used to treat cough and some plant compounds such as pseudoephedrine from ephedra and codeine from opium poppy have been developed into drugs. Text mining historical literature may offer new insight for future therapeutic development. We identified natural products used in the East Asian historical literature to treat chronic cough. Evaluation of the historical literature revealed 331 natural products used to treat chronic cough. Products included plants, minerals and animal substances. These natural products were found in 75 different books published between AD 363 and 1911. Of the 331 products, the 10 most frequently and continually used products were examined, taking into consideration findings from contemporary experimental studies. The natural products identified are promising and offer new directions in therapeutic development for treating chronic cough.

Objective. To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for Childhood Pneumonia. Methods. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The searched electronic databases included PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI, and VIP. All studies included were assessed for quality and risk bias. Review Manager 5.1.6 software was used for data analyses, and the GRADEprofiler software was applied to classify the systematic review results. Results. Fourteen studies were identified (n = 1.824). Chinese herbs may increase total effective rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.26) and improve cough (total mean difference (MD), -2.18; 95% CI, (-2.66)-(-1.71)), fever (total MD, -1.85; 95% CI, (-2.29)-(-1.40)), rales (total MD, -1.53; 95% CI, (-1.84)-(-1.23)), and chest films (total MD, -3.10; 95% CI, (-4.11)-(-2.08)) in Childhood Pneumonia. Chinese herbs may shorten the length of hospital stay (total MD, -3.00; 95% CI, (-3.52)-(-2.48)), but no significant difference for adverse effects (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.09-1.72) was identified. Conclusion. Chinese herbs may increase total effective rate and improve symptoms and signs. However, large, properly randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are required.

Herbal medicines have been used in cough due to their antitussive and expectorant activity. Antitussives act either centrally on the cough center of the brain or peripherally on the cough receptors in the respiratory passages. The antitussive effect of many herbs results from the content of mucilage, which exerts protective and demulcent activity. The activity of expectorant herbs results primarily from their influence on the gastric mucose (saponins and ipec alkaloids). This proves reflex stimulation which leads to an increase in the secretion of bronchial glands. Volatile-oil type expectorant herbs exert a direct stimulatory effect on the bronchial glands by means of local irritation with antibacterial activity. In colds and flu, herbs containing volatile oil can be used; also, volatile oils are ingredients of syrups and liquids as well as external phytomedicines in the form of liniments, ointments, and inhalations. The paper shows the herbs and phytomedicines present on the Polish market used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases.

Cough is the common disease condition which affects patients of every age. Numerous OTC medications available in community pharmacies however no antiviral treatment and even antibiotics has been shown to be effective without pre-existing lung infection. The treatment approach of medicinal herbs has been recognized for many decades and even longer for the treatment and prevention of cough. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mukalbion poly herbal chewable tablets for the treatment of cough with improved palatability against a marketed brand (Poly herbal). For the formulation development of test group, the herbs were supplied by the Procurement department of Herbion Pakistan Pvt. Ltd. Althea officinalis (roots), Hedera helix (leaves) and Sisymbrium irio (seeds) were used for the manufacturing of Mukalbion (poly herbal, test group) chewable tablet. The comparative control clinical trial was carried out during a time frame of 07 months with sample size of 70 patients as per epidemiological software for sample size and each group contained 35 (±5) patients. Chewable tablets were administered and evaluated for effectiveness after 15 days of treatment. The data were collected by the patients through clinical trial questionnaire. The validated quality of life questionnaire (LCQ) was also used for assessment. The results were analyzed by applying paired sample T test by using IBM SPSS version 20.00. The p value was <0.005 at 95% confidence interval for cough variables including cough bouts, viscosity of sputum, chest congestion, sore throat and shortness of breath. The LCQ cough scale score was higher in test group as compared to control group. The test group also showed well tolerated in term of palatability. None of the patient claimed any of the side effects and no compliance were observed against the marketed brand.

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) refer to infections in any part of the respiratory tract, which are common, with most of the world's population contracting at least one infection annually. These infections are becoming important causes of death and morbidity due to the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance that has resulted in reduced efficacy of existing drugs. Different local societies residing in Ethiopia have been reported to use traditional medicinal plants to treat RTIs. Nevertheless, up-to-date summarized data on the diversity of plants used in the traditional medicine system to treat RTIs in Ethiopia are lacking. The purpose of this review was to assess plant species used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory tract infections in Ethiopia. It attempts to compile available data required for undertaking further scientific investigations. The data were collected by searching for published scientific articles and other grey literature. Following this, medicinal plant (MP) diversity, growth forms, plant parts used, modes of remedy preparation and application, sources and distributions, and frequently treated respiratory disorders were examined. An Excel spreadsheet and SigmaPlot software were used to summarize and present the data. Two hundred twenty-nine (229) plant species that have been used to treat respiratory disorders in Ethiopia were documented. Lamiaceae was the most cited family (27 species), followed by Asteraceae (23 species), and Fabaceae (18 species), whereas cough was primarily cited as being treated by MPs and scored the highest frequency of citation (FOC = 243), followed by the common cold (FOC = 151) and asthma (FOC = 63). The top-cited plant species used in the treatment of RTIs were <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> (6.8%), <i>Allium sativum</i> (5.5%), <i>Zingiber officinale</i> (4.2%), <i>Ruta chalepensis</i> (3.8%), and <i>Ocimum lamiifolium</i> (2.8%). Herbs were the dominant plant growth form (46%) used to treat respiratory diseases, and the most commonly used MP parts were leaves (37%). The leading traditional method used for preparation was decoction (25.5%), and the remedies were usually administered orally (64.6%). The MP origin reported was mainly from the wild (59%). High diversity of medicinal plants was reported as being used to treat various RTIs in Ethiopia. Information obtained from this review could be used as a reference for the selection of plants for further pharmacological, phytochemical, and toxicological investigations for their possible therapeutic applications and the development of new plant-based drugs.

Herbs and spices have been used for food and medicinal purposes for centuries - the first recorded evidence of their use dates back to 1500BC and the Ebers Papyrus, which mentioned spices such as anise, mustard, saffron, cinnamon, and cassia. Now, in the 21st century, a variety of secondary compounds produced by plants are used in many fields of industry, such as food production (to improve taste, to provide vitamins and macro- and microelements, and also to inhibit food spoilage caused by foodborne bacteria), in medicine (in the treatment of various diseases; in chemoprevention and cancer therapy; as a source of natural antimicrobials for the treatment of infectious disease), and in pharmacology and cosmetology (in dietary supplements, and as a result of the demand for preservative-free cosmetics, to reduce the risk of methylparaben allergies). The aim of this review is to present the major active compounds in herbs and spices and explore their potential applications in industry.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues, and this condition has caused many cases in various countries around the world, resulting in more than 6 million deaths worldwide. Herbal medicines can act as immunomodulators, anti-inflammatories, antioxidants, antimicrobials, and others depending on the type and content of the herbs used. Previous studies have shown that several types of herbs, such as <i>Echinacea purpurea, Curcumin or Turmeric, Nigella sativa, and Zingiber officinale</i>, have proven their effectiveness as herbal plants for COVID-19.

We review the actions of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) in the treatment of cough and of the conditions associated with it; in particular asthma and upper respiratory tract infections. These therapies may work (1) peripherally, at the sites in the airways and lungs at which cough is being activated, (2) in the brainstem, where the neural "cough center" is situated, or (3) at the cerebral cortex, where cough can be initiated, suppressed or modified by conscious or unconscious controls. Of the large number of trials of CAMs against cough, most are inadequate in design. It may be difficult to randomize selection. Blinding is often impossible both for the patient and the therapist, and adequate placebo controls may be difficult to devise. The patient can usually identify the "active" treatment by the taste or smell of a medicine, or from the approach and apparatus being used. Pure chemicals can be extracted from many of the herbs used as antitussives, and can be shown to be effective in randomized, blind, and controlled trials, but it does not follow that the herb itself, used in the recommended formula and shown to be antitussive, acts by this agency unless a placebo effect is ruled out. A few herbs are identified where the evidence points to a true antitussive action. Of nonherbal treatments, the few positive results are usually outweighed by the larger number of negative ones. Thus, in general, CAMs for cough are welcomed enthusiastically by the patient but lack sound evidence for their efficacy. Antitussive chemicals can be extracted from many herbs, but it is no more than a reasonable hypothesis that the herb itself acts through this pathway.

In many developing countries, community members depend on their local flora for treating diverse ailments including those affecting the respiratory system. This is often attributed to the high cost and limited access to health care facilities. This present study focused on the documentation of plant species used against cough associated with the respiratory diseases in Ede South Local Government Area of Osun State. The survey was conducted using semi-structured interviews among 100 participants. Information obtained was analyzed using different ethno-botanical indices including relative frequency of citation (RFC) and fidelity level (FL). A total of 87 plant species from 39 families, which was mostly represented by Fabaceae, were reported in the study area. <i>Crinum jagus</i> was the most popular plant used against cough and approximately 32% of the plants have been reported as cough remedies for the first time. However, some of the documented plants have been reported for the treatment of cough and related respiratory diseases in several countries. In terms of the life-form, trees constituted the highest proportion of the medicinal plants (37%), while leaves (36%) were the predominant plant part prescribed for cough. Decoction was the main method of preparing the plants, which were all administered orally. Approximately 63% of the plants were exclusively sourced from the wild. The current study revealed the richness and widespread use of plant species for managing cough associated with respiratory diseases in the study area. The generated inventory contributes to the expanding database of valuable plant resources with medicinal potential in Nigeria and Africa.

Healing with herbs has been a common practice for ages. Nowadays, various infectious diseases like malaria, flu, hepatitis B; COVID-19, etc. are commonly spreading around the world as a consequence of environmental pollution and related consequences. These diseases are not well controlled by the present drug treatment. Antibiotics are failing because of bacterial resistance. Although people believe that herbal medicines are more effective and safer. Therefore, traditional herbal remedies have been recommended for treatment purposes throughout the world. They are often used in combination, fused with honey, or alone for curing different types of ailments. Today, modern formulations of these medicines exist in the form of capsules, tablets, powders, and granules. In several traditional systems, 'Honey' is recommended as a natural medicine that improves several health conditions. In 'Ayurveda', honey is considered a most precious and miraculous product of nature and is used to treat various diseases either alone or after its infusion with herbs. It is a natural, antioxidant-rich, and highly nutritious food that is widely used as a natural sweetener without any side effects. It has antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. It also proves fruitful in managing/curing various disorders like colds, coughs, cancer, diabetes, wound healing, and cardiovascular disorders. Honey infused with herbs is also used to repair wounds, diabetes, lymphedema, and the prevention of chronic venomous diseases as a part of the folk medicinal system. The current article aims to analyse the medicinal efficiency of honey infused with herbs for curing/managing/treating various types of ailments.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common pulmonary diseases. The current therapeutic outcomes are not satisfactory and may cause adverse events such as cardiovascular complications. In this study, we aimed to discuss some effective medicinal herbs for the management of COPD.

Baiheqingjin Decoction (BHQJ), which consists of 7 traditional Chinese herbs including Baibu (Stemona tuberosa Lour.), Hezi (Terminalia chebula Retz.), Mahuang (Ephedra sinica Stapf.), Ziwan (Aster tataricus L. f.), Dilong (Pheretima), Sangbaipi (Morus alba L.), and Xianhecao (Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb.). BHQJ is commonly used for treating cough asthma, and variant cough-variant asthma as it, is effective in improving asthma symptoms and reducing airway inflammation.

Mai Men Dong decoction (MMDD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, is relevant to ethnopharmacology due to its constituents and therapeutic properties. The formula contains herbs like Ophiopogon japonicus (Thunb.) Ker Gawl., Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino, Panax ginseng C.A.Mey, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, and Ziziphus jujuba Mill, Oryza sativa L., which have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine. These herbs provide a comprehensive approach to treating respiratory conditions by addressing dryness, cough, and phlegm. Ethnopharmacological studies have explored the scientific basis of these herbs and identified active compounds that contribute to their medicinal effects. The traditional usage of MMDD by different ethnic groups reflects their knowledge and experiences. Examining this formula contributes to the understanding and development of ethnopharmacology.

The prescription of Shenling Baizhu San (SLBZS) was derived from the Song Dynasty "Taiping Huimin Heji Ju Fang", which was a representative prescription for treating spleen asthenic diarrhea. The prescription comprised of 10 herbs for treating weak spleen and stomach. It describes symptoms like eating less, loose stools, cough, shortness of breath and tired limbs. SLBZS has been reported to be capable of eliminating discomfort when it is administered for treating irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. This traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula has been widely used for improving gastrointestinal dysfunction and modifying the immune response to inflammation.

Herbacetin is an active constituent of traditional Chinese medicines such as Ephedra sinica Stapf (MaHuang) and Sedum roseum (L.). Scop. (Hong JingTian). MaHuang was used to treat cough, asthma, fever, and edema for more than 5000 years, while Hong JingTian was used to treat depression, fatigue, cancers, and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies indicate that herbacetin and its glycosides play a critical role in the pharmacological activities of these herbs. However, currently, no comprehensive review on herbacetin has been published yet.

Cough variant asthma (CVA) has no definitive diagnosis or pathogenic causes, and there is currently no effective and safe treatment.

Changium smyrnioides Wolff is a monotypic species of the genus Changium Wolff which is only found in eastern China. C. smyrnioides has been used as a traditional medicine for ages to treat cough, vomiting, nausea, megrim, and carbuncle. It is also widely used to brew medicated liquor and health tea with other herbs in order to moisten the lungs and nourish blood and yin. This review comprehensively summarizes the up-to-date information on the botanical characterization, distribution, traditional uses, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicity of C. smyrnioides based on studies published in recent years. Phytochemical investigations have revealed that phenylpropanoids, volatile oils, fatty acids, phytosterols, and other bioactive compounds are contained in C. smyrnioides. Crude extracts and monomeric compounds isolated from C. smyrnioides have significant effects on the respiratory, immune, and vascular systems and exhibit favourable activities such as antitussive, eliminating phlegm, anti-asthmatic, immunoregulatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-fatigue, anti-hypoxia, and anti-atherosclerotic effects. C. smyrnioides is a promising medicinal herb with immense therapeutic and health-promoting effects. Therefore, further studies on the bioactive compounds and mechanisms of C. smyrnioides are necessary. Additional clinical and toxicological studies are warranted to evaluate its safety.

To assess the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Ophiopogonis Radix (Maidong in Chinese), the root of Ophiopogon japonicus, is widely used in local medicines of China, Japan and some south-eastern Asian countries. According to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principle, Ophiopogonis Radix nourishes the yin, promotes body fluid production, moistens the lung, eases the mind and clears away heart fire. This review summarizes the achievements of the investigations in botany, phytochemistry, quality control, traditional uses, pharmacological activities and clinical studies on O. japonicus; this review also describes the shortcomings of studies on this herbal drug and thus serves as the basis of further scientific research and development of this traditional herbal drug.

To systematically investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese herbs (TCHs) as an alternative to conventional medicine (CM) in children with cough variant asthma(CVA).

COVID-19 caused a global pandemic problem. No confident management is introduced for it yet. This study aimed to propose a dietary protocol for hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of acute respiratory infectious disease caused by COVID-19 based on Persian Medicine.

In the genus Curculigo, Curculigo orchioides Gaertn, Curculigo capitulata (Lour) O. Ktze and Curculigo pilosa (Schumach. & Thonn.) Engl are often used in traditional medicine. Curculigo orchioides is used for the treatment of impotence, limb limpness, arthritis of the lumbar and knee joints, and watery diarrhea in traditional Chinese medicine, and also used as a potent immunomodulator and aphrodisiac in the Ayurvedic medical system. Curculigo capitulata is used for the treatment of consumptive cough, kidney asthenia, impotence and spermatorrhea, hemorrhoids, asthma, jaundice, diarrhea, colic and gonorrhea in traditional Chinese and India medicine, and to treat urinary tract infection, acute renal pelvis and nephritis, nephritis-edema, cystitis, nephrolithiasis, hypertension and rheumatic arthritis in traditional Dai medicine. Curculigo pilosa are applied to treat gastrointestinal and heart diseases in Africa.

Traditional medicine is a major component in the primary healthcare system in the southeast of Iran, which has a rich floral diversity. However, there is no comprehensive report on the use of medicinal herbs in this specific region. This traditional usage of medicinal plants by local communities could serve as a source for pharmacological and phytochemical studies. The main objective of this study was to identify ethnopharmacological knowledge on medicinal plant species and their local healing applications by the folk communities of Kerman province in the southeast of Iran.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in China for thousands of years to treat and prevent diseases. TCM has been proven safe and effective, and it is being considered as one of the important types of complementary and alternative medicine and receives increasing attention worldwide. The dried root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. (also known as "Hu Zhang" in Chinese) is one of the medicinal herbs listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. Hu Zhang is widely distributed in the world. It can be found in Asia and North America and is used as folk medicine in countries such as Japan and Korea. In China, Hu Zhang is usually used in combination with other TCM herbs. The therapeutic uses of those Hu Zhang-containing TCM prescriptions or formulations are for treating cough, hepatitis, jaundice, amenorrhea, leucorrhea, arthralgia, burns and snake bites. Recent pharmacological and clinical studies have indicated that Hu Zhang has antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective functions. This review gives a summary of the reported therapeutic effects of the active compounds and the different extracts of Hu Zhang.

Allergic symptoms caused by spices and herbs are infrequent and usually mild, although occasionally, severe allergic reactions do occur. Symptoms of pruritus, rhinitis, cough, and edema have been reported to spices including curry, paprika, pepper, and mustard. To our knowledge, this is the first case of confirmed dill allergy, and the patient had severe allergic symptoms.

The genus Cratoxylum contained medicinal herbs, which are widely distributed in South-East Asia and China. Plants of this genus were consumed as a vegetable side dish, a spice, an ingredient in soup, or a substitute for tea, as well as they are traditionally appropriate for various diseases such as fever, cough, flu, diarrhoea, etc. The most aims of the current review are to highlight the ultimate information about the traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology of Cratoxylum medicinal plants.

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has extensively spread worldwide with high mortality. Besides vaccination, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved only one oral medication as a treatment. Medicinal plants with antiviral and immunomodulatory properties could be explored as complementary treatments for COVID-19. Ogbomosho is home to such plants traditionally used to treat infectious diseases in Nigeria, making it relevant in complementary medicine. An ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plants used to treat COVID-19 and related ailments, including cough and flu in Ogbomosho South and North Local Government Areas, Nigeria, was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire. Information was obtained from 56 participants, consisting of different groups of individuals with native knowledge of medicinal plants, and ethnobotanical indices, including the frequency of citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC), and fidelity level (FL) were computed. Twenty-six medicinal plants (17 families) were used to treat COVID-19, 31 (20 families) for cough, and 29 (19 families) for flu. The most cited plant was <i>Zingiber officinale</i> (FC = 10; RFC = 0.18; FL = 18%) for treating COVID-19, <i>Citrus limon</i> (FC = 13; RFC = 0.23; FL = 23%) for cough, and <i>Zingiber officinale</i> (FC = 9; RFC = 0.16; FL = 16%) for flu. Leaves were the most used plant part for treating COVID-19 and flu, while the bark was the most used for cough. Trees and herbs were the most cited plant growth forms. The herbal remedies were mostly prepared by decoction and infusion and were mainly administered orally. Further research should be conducted on the identified species for the scientific validation of their antiviral and immunomodulatory efficacies and safety for use.

COVID-19, which was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, is a respiratory illness caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although some patients infected with COVID-19 can remain asymptomatic, most experience a range of symptoms that can be mild to severe. Common symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of taste or smell and muscle aches. In severe cases, complications can arise including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, organ failure and even death, particularly in older adults or individuals with underlying health conditions. Treatments for COVID-19 include remdesivir, which has been authorised for emergency use in some countries, and dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation in severe cases. Biological drugs including monoclonal antibodies, such as casirivimab and imdevimab, have also been authorised for emergency use in certain situations. While these treatments have improved the outcome for many patients, there is still an urgent need for new treatments. Medicinal plants have long served as a valuable source of new drug leads and may serve as a valuable resource in the development of COVID-19 treatments due to their broad-spectrum antiviral activity. To date, various medicinal plant extracts have been studied for their cellular and molecular interactions, with some demonstrating anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. This review explores the evaluation and potential therapeutic applications of these plants against SARS-CoV-2. This review summarises the latest evidence on the activity of different plant extracts and their isolated bioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on the application of plant-derived compounds in animal models and in human studies.

Cough-relieving medicinal herbs in tea are used from ancient times. Mucilage present in them or secretion produced under the influence of the active substances covers the oral and throat mucosa soothing its irritability and relieving dry, tiresome cough. It is known that the mixtures of medicinal herbs (Specias) have a complex influence on the human organism and the rational combination of medicinal herbs can improve their curative action and decrease the undesirable side effects. Having summarized the properties of those medicinal herbs we decided to create two formulations of cough-relieving herbal tea. The first formulation consists of marshmallow roots, liquorice roots and lime flowers, the second -- of marshmallow roots, Iceland moss and lime flowers. The methods for identification and assay of the active substances in the compounds were applied. The purity of the mixtures was regulated by limitation of the loss on drying, total ash, microbial contamination, contamination with radionuclides, heavy metals, pesticides and foreign matter. The expiry date of both cough-relieving herbal teas was approved to be 2 years.

Glycyrrhiza has a long history of applications and a wide range of pharmacological effects. It is known as the "king of all herbs". Glycyrrhiza is effective in clearing heat, detoxifying, relieving cough, and tonifying qi and has good bioactivity in multiple inflammatory, immune, and tumor diseases. This review aims to summarize the origin, distribution, and anti-digestive system tumor mechanism of glycyrrhiza and its homologous applications in medicine and food. The active compounds include triterpenoids, flavonoids, and coumarins, which are widely used in clinical treatments, disease prevention, and daily foods because of their "enhancement of efficacy" and "reduction of toxicity" against digestive system tumors. This paper reviews the use of glycyrrhiza in digestive system tumors and provides an outlook on future research and clinical applications.

Northern conditions are characterised by long days with much light and low temperatures during the growing season. It has been chimed that herbs and berries grown in the north are stronger tasting compared to those of southern origin. The compounds imparting aroma and color to berries and herbs are secondary metabolites which in plants mostly act as chemical means of defense. Recently, the production of secondary metabolites using plant cells has been the subject of expanding research. Light intensity, photoperiod and temperature have been reported to influence the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. Native wild aromatic and medicinal plant species of different families are being studied to meet the needs of raw material for the expanding industry of e.g., health-promoting food products known as nutraceutics. There are already a large number of known secondary compounds produced by plants, but the recent advances in modern extraction and analysis should enable many more as yet unknown compounds to be found, characterised and utilised. Rose root (Rhodiola rosea) is a perennial herbaceous plant which inhabits mountain regions throughout Europe, Asia and east coastal regions of North America. The extract made from the rhizomes acts as a stimulant like the Ginseng root. Roseroot has been categorized as an adaptogen and is reported to have many pharmacological properties. The biologically active components of the extract are salitroside tyrosol and cinnamic acid glycosides (rosavin, rosarin, rosin). Round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia L.) has circumboreal distribution. It inhabits nutrient-poor, moist and sunny areas such as peat bogs and wetlands. Sundew leaves are collected from the wild-type for various medicinal preparations and can be utilized in treating e.g., as an important "cough-medicine" for different respiratory diseases. The antimicrobial activity of extracts of aerial parts against various bacteria has been investigated. Drosera produces various secondary metabolites. The most abundant, among these compounds, are the naphthoquinones. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is a characteristic field layer species in boreal forests. Bilberry and other northern Vaccinium species, berries and leaves, contain high amounts of phenolic compounds. Bilberries are known for its exceptionally high amounts ofanthocyanins with powerful antioxidant capacity. They have been shown to possess beneficial health effects, like having a protective role in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Many flavonoids also seem to have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiallergenic properties. The effect of ingested cranberry (V. oxycoccus) juice has been shown to prevent urinary tract infections in women.

In a randomised single blind trial the Chinese herbs Shuang Huang Lian were evaluated for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. Children with acute bronchiolitis and serological evidence of recent respiratory syncytial virus infection were studied in a tertiary hospital in Harbin, China. The 96 children were randomised into three treatment groups: herbs, herbs with antibiotics, and antibiotics alone. The herbs were prepared by the medical school pharmacy and administered daily by intravenous infusion for seven days. The main outcomes, assessed blindly, were symptomatic improvement in cough, fever, wheezing, chest signs, and duration of stay in hospital. The mean duration of symptoms from the start of treatment was 6.2 (confidence interval 5.6 to 6.9) days in the two groups treated with herbs compared with 8.6 (confidence interval 7.5 to 9.8) days in the group treated with antibiotics alone. The mean reductions in duration of clinical manifestations for treatment with antibiotics alone compared with herbs were: from 3.1 to 1.5 days for fever, 9.1 to 6.1 days for cough, 6.5 to 4.1 days for wheezing, and 7.2 to 4.9 days for chest crackles. No adverse effect of Shuang Huang Lian herbal treatment was detected. In conclusion, this study confirms Chinese experience with Shuang Huang Lian that it is safe and effective, and warrants further study.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown significant efficacy in the treatment of cough variant asthma (CVA), a special type of asthma. However, there is shortage of explanations for relevant mechanism of treatment. As Zhengs differentiation is a critical concept in TCM, it is necessary to explain the mechanism of treatment of Zhengs. Based on TCM clinical cases, this study illustrated the mechanism of the treatment of three remarkably relevant Zhengs for CVA: "FengXieFanFei," "FeiQiShiXuan", and "QiDaoLuanJi." To achieve this goal, five steps were carried out: (1) determining feature Zhengs and corresponding key herbs of CVA by analyses of clinical cases; (2) finding out potential targets of the key herbs and clustering them based on their functional annotations; (3) constructing an ingredient-herb network and an ingredient network; (4) identifying modules of the ingredient network; (5) illustrating the mechanism of the treatment by further mining the latent biological implications within each module. The systematic study reveals that the treatment of "FengXieFanFei," "FeiQiShiXuan," and "QiDaoLuanJi" has effects on the regulation of multiple bioprocesses by herbs containing different ingredients with functions of steroid metabolism regulation, airway inflammation, and ion conduction and transportation. This network-based systematic study will be a good way to boost the scientific understanding of mechanism of the treatment of Zhengs.

<i>Pinellia ternata</i> (Thunb.) Breit. is a well-known perennial herb that is used in traditional medicine in China, Japan and Korea. It's drawing worldwide interests in medicinal applications owing such as anti-diarrhea, lipid-lowering, anti-tumor, anti-cough, expectorant, anti-gastric ulcer, etc.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly discovered RNA virus that belongs to corona virus group. It leads to an infectious state manifested as fever, loss of smell and taste sensations, cough, myalgia, fatigue and headache. The condition may become more serious as difficulty in breathing, chest pain and even death. Until successful vaccine is developed, complimentary and herbal medicine can be used as alternative prevention measure against COVID-19 in high-risk populations. This is because the none of the traditional agents used in the treatment protocols had proven effective results. In addition, recent studies reported that dietary supplements and herbal agents may have effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute efficiently to amelioration of the effects of COVID-19. This review sheds light on the possible role of the natural agents in the management of COVID-19 with reference to the role of the primary care in this issue.

The use of multipronged measures, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has greatly increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we found the use of TCM and is positively correlated with the regional cure rate in China (R=0.77, <i>P</i><10<sup>-5</sup>). We analyzed 185 commonly administered TCM recipes comprised of 210 herbs nationwide to reveal mechanistic insight. Eight out of the 10 most commonly used herbs showed anti-coronavirus potential by intersecting with COVID-19 targets. Intriguingly, 17 compounds from the 5 most commonly used herbs were revealed to have direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential by docking with the two core structures [CoV spike (S) glycoprotein (6SVB) and CoV 3CL hydrolase (6LU7)]. Seven reported COVID-19 drugs served as positive controls; among them, retionavir (-7.828 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-8.738 kcal/mol) performed best with 6VSB and 6LU7, respectively. The top candidate was madreselvin B (6SVB: -8.588 kcal/mol and 6LU7: -9.017 kcal/mol), an appreciable component of Flos Lonicerae. Eighty-six compounds from 22 unlisted herbs were further identified among 2,042 natural compounds, completing our arsenal for TCM formulations. The mechanisms have been implicated as multifactorial, including activation of immunoregulation (Th2, PPAR and IL10), suppression of acute inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1α/β, TNF, COX2/1, etc.), enhancement of antioxidative activity (CAT and SOD1), and modulation of apoptosis (inhibited CASP3). It is of interest to understand the biological mechanisms of TCM recipes. We then analyzed 18 representative remedies based on molecular targets associated with 14 medical conditions over the disease course, e.g., pyrexia, coughing, asthenia, lymphopenia, cytokine storm, etc. The significant level of coherence (SLC) revealed, in part, the potential uses and properties of corresponding TCMs. Thus, herbal plants coordinate to combat COVID-19 in multiple dimensions, casting a light of hope before effective vaccines are developed.

Polygalae Radix (Polygalaceae), the dried root of Polygala tenuifolia Willd. and Polygala sibirica L., has been widely used as a medicine for improving cognitive function. In China, Polygalae Radix has been widely used in the treatment of insomnia, forgetfulness, depression, cough, palpitation, and other diseases. More than 140 compounds have been isolated from Polygalae Radix, including saponins, xanthones, oligosaccharide esters, and so on. The compounds and extracts isolated from Polygalae Radix possess wide-ranging pharmacological activities, such as neuroprotective, antidepressant, hypnotic-sedative, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antitumor, antioxidant, antiaging, and antiarrhythmic effects, among others. The clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine has proved that raw Polygalae Radix can irritate the throat. Modern studies have found that raw Polygalae Radix exhibits a certain degree of toxicity to the gastrointestinal tract after long-term use or excessive doses and that its main toxic components are saponins. Thus, Polygalae Radix is usually processed, and/or combined with other herbs to reduce gastrointestinal irritation. This review investigated the pharmacokinetics of Polygalae Radix. Future research perspectives and the existing problems of Polygalae Radix were also discussed. This review can broaden the understanding regarding Polygalae Radix and provide references for further research.

The family Gesneriaceae comprises ca. 150 genera and 3000 species, distributed in the tropics around the world. It is constituted of herbs, lianas, or shrubs, frequently with ornamental potential, due to the beauty of their flowers. Some species have been used in traditional medicine, mainly against fever, cough, colds, snakebite, pains, and infectious and inflammatory diseases. Although Gesneriaceae are a large family, only few species were chemically investigated, and this took place mainly in the last decade. In the present work, chemical and pharmacological studies on Gesneriaceae are reviewed based on original articles published. Altogether 300 compounds have been reported in Gesneriaceae species, including flavonoids, terpenes and steroids, phenolic glucosides, simple phenolics, quinones, lignans, xanthones, and compounds with unusual skeletons. Several species had been used in folk medicine, and some constituents have shown biological activities, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflamatory, antioxidant, and antitumor properties.

Dioscorea nipponica Makino is a perennial twining herbs belonging to the family Dioscoreaceae, which is mainly distributed in the northeastern, northern, eastern and central regions of China. Traditionally, the rhizome of this herb has been commonly used by Miao and Meng ethnic groups of China to treat rheumatoid arthritis, pain in the legs and lumbar area, Kashin Beck disease, bruises, sprains, chronic bronchitis, cough and asthma. Modern pharmacological studies have discovered that this herb possesses anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-diuretic, analgesic, anti-tussive, panting-calming and phlegm-dispelling activities, along with enhancing immune function and improving cardiovascular health. In recent years, both fat-soluble and water-soluble steroidal saponins were isolated from the rhizomes of D. nipponica using silica gel column chromatography, thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography methods. Saponin and sapogenins are mainly responsible for most of the pharmacological effects of this plant. Further, the chemical components of the aboveground parts contain more than 10 kinds of phenanthrene derivatives. The present review summarizes the knowledge concerning the geographical distribution, chemical composition, pharmacological effects, toxicology studies and clinical applications of D. nipponica.
