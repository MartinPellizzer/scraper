Study objective: As part of the APHEA project this study examined the association between airborne
particles and hospital admissions for cardiac causes (ICD9 390–429) in eight European cities (Barcelona, Birmingham, London, Milan, the Netherlands, Paris, Rome, and Stockholm). All admissions were
studied, as well as admissions stratified by age. The association for ischaemic heart disease (ICD9
410–413) and stroke (ICD9 430–438) was also studied, also stratified by age.
Design: Autoregressive Poisson models were used that controlled for long term trend, season,
influenza epidemics, and meteorology to assess the short-term effects of particles in each city. The study
also examined confounding by other pollutants. City specific results were pooled in a second stage
regression to obtain more stable estimates and examine the sources of heterogeneity.
Main results: The pooled percentage increases associated with a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 and
black smoke were respectively 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.4 to 1.8) for cardiac
admissions of all ages, 0.7% (95% CI: 0.4 to 1.0) and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.4 to 2.2) for cardiac admissions over 65 years, and, 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3 to 1.2) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.7 to 1.5) for ischaemic
heart disease over 65 years. The effect of PM10 was little changed by control for ozone or SO2, but was
substantially reduced (CO) or eliminated (NO2) by control for other traffic related pollutants. The effect
of black smoke remained practically unchanged controlling for CO and only somewhat reduced controlling for NO2.
Conclusions: These effects of particulate air pollution on cardiac admissions suggest the primary effect
is likely to be mainly attributable to diesel exhaust. Results for ischaemic heart disease below 65 years
and for stroke over 65 years were inconclusive.

I

n the past decade, a number of epidemiological studies have
shown that ambient air pollution adversely affects human
health even at levels lower than current national
standards.1 Particulate matter is the pollutant that has most
consistently been associated with short-term effects in
mortality. The independence of this association from other
pollutants, especially SO2, has been questioned. In particular,
this independent effect of particulate matter has been shown
in the US.2 3 In Europe the impact of SO2 was not modified by
particles levels,4 the impact of particles was reduced somewhat by control for SO2.4 5 The impact of air pollution on hospital admissions is less documented in Europe especially
regarding cardiovascular causes.6–9
The association between air pollution and daily mortality
and hospital admissions has been studied in Europe, mostly
within the APHEA project (Air pollution and Health: a European Approach). This study has found consistent results for
mortality in large Western European cities.3 10 11 For hospital
admissions, though, only respiratory diseases were
investigated.12–14 The objective of this paper is to study the
short-term effect of particles on hospital admissions for
cardiovascular diseases.

METHODS
Table 1 shows daily mean hospital admissions for cardiac diseases (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision,
390–429), ischaemic heart diseases (ICD9,410–3), and stroke
(ICD9, 430–8) by age groups in eight European cities. The
Netherlands was taken as one large urban area. This was justified by the fact that the level of particulate air pollution in
urban areas was the same as for the non-urban part of the
Netherlands,15 and by the high correlation among the PM10

monitors in the country. For example, Verhoeff and coworkers
found the correlation between PM10 in Rotterdam and
Amsterdam so high (>0.90) that they were able to substitute
Rotterdam measurements when data were missing in
Amsterdam.16 Routine registers in all cities provided daily
admission data. Emergency admissions were used in every
city except in Milan, Paris, and Rome where only general
admissions data were available. In Rome although the system
does not permit a straightforward classification of emergency
admissions, those conditions that were more likely to be elective were excluded. The excluded codes have been selected
based on the comparison between emergency and elective
admissions of the London data 1992–94. We excluded the
corresponding codes when 70% or more of the admissions
were elective admissions. To this list we added code 414,
“Other forms of chronic ischaemic heart disease”. Approximately 65% of these admissions are elective, and while it does
not meet the 70% cut off point, the actual numbers are so
great that they could have an impact on the results for
ischaemic heart disease and cardiovascular diseases. The
Netherlands did not provide information for cardiac causes
for all ages or old people. The pollutants, both particles and
gases, were those generally measured in European cities
(tables 2 and 3). Pollution levels were assessed by fixed
monitoring sites. Monitors with too many missing values
were excluded, using previously published criteria.17 A standardised procedure 17 was used to fill in days with missing data.
A missing value on day i in year k in monitoring station j was
replaced by a weighted average of the values from the rest of
the monitoring stations—that is:

Particles were measured mostly by PM10, except in Paris (PM13)
and in Milan and Rome (total suspended particulate, TSP). To
ensure comparability of the results, TSP estimates in Milan
and Rome have been scaled to equivalent PM10 measures using
a locally derived conversion factor of 0.75.18 For Paris, the PM13
values were taken as being equivalent to PM10 in the analyses.
Five cities were also able to provide black smoke data (BS).
Sulphur dioxide (24 hour average), nitrogen dioxide (hourly
values and 24 hour average), and ozone (hourly value and
maximum eight hour average) measurements were available
in all cities and carbon monoxide (eight hour average) in all
except Paris. Stations were chosen to represent background
inner city air quality levels, except for ozone. Thus, stations
located by limited access highways were excluded.
Each centre collected, prepared, and sent its data to the
centre (Paris) in which the analysis was centralised. The statistical analysis followed a jointly decided methodology.
Autoregressive Poisson models allowing for overdispersion
were fitted. We controlled for potential confounders including
long term trend, season, days of the week, holidays, influenza
epidemics, temperature, and humidity.19 We used generalised
additive models 20 to adjust for non-linear relations between
confounders and morbidity. Diagnostic tools for the models
included the partial autocorrelation function of the residuals
and Akaïke’s information criterion (AIC).21
Hospital admissions are often highly correlated over time.
This results in part from environmental factors such as
season, meteorology, or pollution, but also from other factors
such as day of the week and readmissions. The inclusion of the
omitted variables (season, weather, . . .) reduces the degree of
serial correlation in the outcome series and therefore a good
indicator of the omission of explanatory variables is residual
autocorrelation. In our study, seasonal control was achieved by
minimising the autocorrelation in the residuals and by examination of residuals plots. We systematically included a smooth
function of temperature and humidity for the same day as the
admissions. Inclusion of lagged effects up to three days or
averaged on one to three days for temperature and humidity,
was based on AIC. Interaction between temperature and
humidity was also investigated. In every city, particles were
introduced as a linear term, using the average of the levels on
the day of admission and the preceding day. It has been shown
that log transformed air pollutant concentrations give the best
fit in settings with high levels of air pollution (that is, higher
than 150 µg/m3 for particles, SO2 or BS).22 Therefore, in our
meta-analysis, using linear terms for PM10, we restricted the
analysis to days with levels of air pollution below 150 µg/m3. If
serial correlation remained in the residuals of the final
models, autoregression terms were added.23
To provide a quantitative summary of results across the cities, we applied hierarchical methods by obtaining a pooled
regression coefficient as a weighted mean of city specific
regression coefficients. The weights used were inversely

www.jech.com

proportional to the city specific estimate’s variance. We determined the weights assuming a fixed effects model when a χ2
test failed to detect heterogeneity at the sensitive level of
α=20%. The between cities variance was estimated from the
data using the moment method of Der Simonian and Laird.24
When the assumption of homogeneity had to be rejected and
at least five coefficients were available to ensure enough
power, we conducted a second stage regression of local coefficients on non-time dependent effect modifiers, following the
method developed by Berkey et al.25 We fit this regression using
weighted least squares with weights inversely proportional to
the variance, including a random variance component. Tables
3 and 4 show an overview of potential effect modifiers
collected in each centre. These were indicators of the general
population health status (percentage of smokers, standardised
lung cancer mortality, proportion of death in people over 65
years and standardised mortality), climate conditions (temperature and humidity), situation of air pollution (number of
monitoring stations, pollution levels, and correlation between
pollutants and meteorological variables). As only eight cities
were available, effect modifier were included alternatively in
the models.
When heterogeneity was present and less than five cities
were available, a random effect model was adopted. In this
model, the between cities variance is added to each estimated
local variance, thus giving more similar weights, but also a
larger overall variance. This variance inflation reflects greater
uncertainty about the summary estimate when local results
are heterogeneous.
In each city, we applied also two pollutant models, in which
particles and another pollutant were simultaneously included
into the model as linear terms. Second stage regressions on
these models were also performed following the methodology
developed by Berkey et al.26 Specific functions were written to
perform autoregressive GAM model 23 and meta regression in
S-plus software.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the daily means of hospital admissions during
the study period. The cities comprise a total population close to
38 million, including 15 million people from the Netherlands
(table 4).
Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for particles. The
daily mean levels for PM10 ranged from 15.5 µg/m3 in
Stockholm to 52.5 µg/m3 in Rome. Daily mean levels for BS
ranged from 12.5 µg/m3 in the Netherlands to 38.7 µg/m3 in
Barcelona. Correlation coefficients between PM10 and BS
measures ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 (data not shown). Table 3
presents the daily mean levels for the other pollutants. SO2
daily mean levels ranged from 3.8 µg/m3 in Stockholm to 29
µg/m3 in Milan. The highest levels of O3 were in Stockholm,
Barcelona, and the Netherlands. The levels of NO2 reached 86.5
µg/m3 in Rome and 97.9 µg/m3 in Milan. The highest levels of
CO were in Barcelona. Yearly average of temperature ranged
from 8.0°C in Stockholm to 16.8°C in Barcelona. Rome was the
driest city and the Netherlands the wettest. The number of
particle monitoring stations in each city ranged between 1 and
12.
The following analysis presents for each outcome, firstly,
results for individual cities, secondly, pooled estimates and if
heterogeneity is found, a complementary analysis to explain
it.

positive except in Birmingham, and reached the nominal significance level (5%) in two cities (London and Milan). The

random joint effect estimate was a 0.5% increase in
admissions (95 % CI: 0.2 to 0.8). The PM10 results showed some
heterogeneity across cities (p for heterogeneity =0.17). Eighty
four per cent of this heterogeneity was explained by the correlation between PM10 and NO2. Alternatively, the proportion of
all cardiac admissions occurring in people over 65 years of age
explained 87% of the heterogeneity. The additional increase in
admissions associated with a 10 µg/m3 of PM10, for the city
with either the highest correlation between PM10 and NO2 or
the highest proportion of cardiac admissions for people over
65 years, was respectively of 0.5% and 0.7% compared with the
city with the lowest correlation or proportion. Results for BS
Table 4

were heterogeneous (p for heterogeneity =0.03), but with
only four cities, we were not able to further investigate the
source of the observed heterogeneity. The random joint effect
was equal to a 1.1% rise in admissions (95 % CI: 0.4 to 1.8)
(table 5).

fixed and random effect estimates associated with a 10 µg/m3
increase in the average of PM10 for 0 and 1 day average lag.

Ischaemic heart disease admissions for people less
than 65 years
Results for ischaemic heart disease for people below 65 years
in relation with PM10 were not conclusive. Four of eight local
estimates were positive, and only one significant (London).
The overall random or fixed effect estimates were equal to 0.3
and non-significant (table 5). There was no significant heterogeneity in PM10 results across cities (p for heterogeneity
=0.24). Results for BS were also inconclusive as we found a
negative effect in one city, a null effect in another one, and a
positive one in three cities. Confidence intervals were
non-significant. The fixed effects estimate associated to 10
µg/m3 increase in BS was equal to 0.1% (95 % CI: −0.4 to 0.5)
(table 5). No heterogeneity was found (p for heterogeneity
=0.87).

Ischaemic heart disease admissions for people over 65
years
Figure 3 shows the city specific as well as the pooled fixed and
random effect estimates and their 95% CI associated with a 10
µg/m3 increase in the average of PM10 for 0 and 1 day average
lag on ischaemic heart disease admissions for people over 65
years. All the city specific estimates were positive, except in
Barcelona, and they reached the nominal significance level
(5%) in four cities (London, Netherlands, Paris, and Stockholm). The random joint effect estimate was equal to a 0.7%
rise in admissions (95 % CI: 0.3 to 1.2). The PM10 results were
heterogeneous across cities (p for heterogeneity =0.07).
Factors that univariately explained some of this heterogeneity
were the standardised lung cancer mortality rate (25% of it),
the correlation between PM10 and CO 8h, (40% of it), and the
annual level of O3 (41% of it). Figure 4 shows the city specific
PM10 effect estimates for ischaemic heart disease admissions
in people over 65 years plotted versus the annual mean level of
O3 in each city. The triangles represent the individual city estimate and the error bar, its 95% CI. The line corresponds to the
fitted regression of these estimates versus the annual mean
level of O3, and the bubbles centered around individual
estimates are proportional to the local weight used in univariate metaregression. This regression was significant at p<0.05,
and the magnitude of the effect modification was substantial.

Stockholm). The fixed joint effect estimate was equal to a 0.7%
rise in admissions (95 % CI: 0.4 to 1.0). There was no substantial heterogeneity in PM10 results across cities (p for
heterogeneity =0.56). Results for BS showed some heterogeneity (p for heterogeneity =0.02). The random joint effect estimate was equal to a 1.3% rise in admissions (95 % CI 0.4 to
2.2) (table 5).

Figure 4 The estimated percentage increase in ischaemic heart
disease admissions is shown for people over 65 years associated
with a 10 µg/m3 increase in the average of PM10 for 0 and 1 day
average lag plotted versus the annual mean level of ozone.

10 µg/m3 rise in PM10, for the city with either the lowest correlation between PM10 and CO or the lowest standardised lung
cancer mortality or the lowest annual level O3 was respectively
of 1.2%, 0.8%, and 1.4% compared to the city with the highest
correlation or lung cancer mortality or annual level of O3.
The fixed joint effect estimate associated with a 10 µg/m3
increase in BS on ischaemic heart disease admissions for
people over 65 years was equal to 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.5) (table
5). There was no significant heterogeneity in BS results across
cities (p for heterogeneity =0.28).
Stroke admissions for people over 65 years
Results for stroke for people over 65 years in relation with PM10
were less conclusive. Four of eight local estimates were
positive, but non-significant. The fixed joint effect estimate
was equal to zero. There was no substantial heterogeneity (p
for heterogeneity =0.74). The same pattern occurred for BS
with a fixed joint estimate equal to −0.1 (95% CI −0.5 to 0.4)
(table 5).
Two pollutant models
We next examined the potential that the above associations
were confounded by other pollutants by fitting two pollutant
models for hospital admissions for cardiac causes (all ages and
for people over 65 years) and for ischaemic heart disease for

777

people over 65. In these two pollutant models, we calculated
overall and specific (one for each pollutant) χ2 tests for
heterogeneity. When the specific test on particles led to a
rejection of the hypothesis of homogeneity, we used a random
effect model, otherwise we used a fixed effect model. Special
attention was paid to PM10 BS models. In this case, if one of the
overall or specific tests led to heterogeneous results, randomeffect models were used. In some cities, BS or CO were not
available. To compare the PM10 or BS effects between a single
and a two pollutant model in the same cities, we first
calculated pooled results for PM10 and BS, excluding cities
with missing BS data for PM10 analyses, or missing CO data for
BS or PM10 analyses. The estimates were similar, although their
variance were slightly larger. PM10 estimates and 95% CI were
stable after controlling for O3 or SO2 (table 6). Controlling for
CO reduced the estimated effect size and, widened the confidence intervals. PM10 estimates became close to zero when
combined with NO2, or BS. We also observed an inflation of the
variance estimates, leading to wide confidence intervals.
BS results (table 7) were more consistent and robust, except
with control for NO2. Controlling for NO2, diminished the BS
effect by a factor of almost two for cardiac admissions, and
almost four for ischaemic heart disease. The sum of the BS and
NO2 effects was of the same magnitude as the one for BS in a
single pollutant model. For cardiac admissions, all ages, BS
estimates, controlling for any pollutant (including PM10) but
not NO2 were mostly unchanged and remained significant at
the nominal level of 5%. For cardiac admissions, for people
over 65 years, BS estimates controlling for pollutants other
than NO2, were mostly unchanged but remained significant at
the nominal level of 5% only for the CO and PM10 models. The
estimate for ischaemic heart disease for people over 65 was
quite robust, except with NO2, but combined with PM10, its
variance was wider and it was no longer significant.

DISCUSSION
This combined analysis summarises the results from eight
European cities concerning the short-term effects of PM10 and
BS on hospital admissions for cardiovascular causes. It should
be noted that certain frequently encountered problems of
meta-analysis do not apply in our study.4 There was no selection bias in the sense that the participating cities were not
selected based on the results of their analysis, but were preselected in advance, based on their ability to provide data. All the
city specific analyses were centralised in one place, giving
homogeneity in the statistical methodology. Data on exposures and confounding factors were collected to an agreed
specification to ensure consistency across cities. One problem

Key points
• Eight European cities provided data on hospital admissions
and air pollution.
• There is little evidence of an impact of particles on hospital
admissions for ischaemic heart disease in people below 65
years or stroke for people over 65 years.
• The primary effect of particulate air pollution on cardiac
admissions is probably mainly attributable to diesel
exhaust.

encountered with data comparability on health outcomes was
that Paris, Milan, and Rome were not able to provide
emergency admissions only. An analysis of London data
showed that emergency admissions were the main part of
general admissions for cardiovascular causes, the proportion
of emergency to total admissions (all ages) being 62% for cardiac, 82% for ischaemic heart disease, and 80% for stroke.
Because Paris, Milan, and Rome have non-elective admissions,
this would tend to underestimate the coefficients compared
with the cities that have only emergency admissions.
A common criticism of meta-analyses of air pollution health
effects, is that they combine relative risks chosen at different
lags, thus maximising the impact of air pollution. To avoid this
criticism, an a priori choice of a mean of exposure on the day
of and day before the event was made. However, defining a
priori a fixed lag between exposure and response for each city
can induce heterogeneity in the results, as the effect of air pollution may differ in time between cities, depending on the
frailty of the population, processes of admission to hospital,
ventilation rates of buildings or the exposure to air pollution.
Variations in the serial correlation of the exposure variable
may also affect how well a two day unweighted mean
represents the true lagged effect of air pollution, which may be
spread over more than two days, but with unequal weights. A
recent paper examined distributed lag models versus single
day exposures, or the mean of two days, in 10 US cities. It
reported that there were city to city variations in how well the
two day mean did in explaining the overall effect of PM10 on all
cause mortality.27 Similar results have also been reported for
hospital admissions for cardiac disease.9
We found a significant effect of PM10 and BS on admissions
for cardiac causes (all ages), and cardiac causes and ischaemic
heart disease for people over 65 years. The percentage
increases associated with a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 and BS
were respectively around 0.5 and 1. The impact of PM10 per
unit of pollution is half of that found in the United States.4 9
The pattern of the PM associations in combination with
other air pollutants was quite suggestive. PM10 did not seem to
be confounded by O3 or SO2. The effect was reduced when CO
was incorporated in the regression model and eliminated
when controlling for NO2. CO is primary a traffic pollutant
representing mainly gasoline fuelled engines and NO2 a
secondary pollutant also mainly influenced by traffic (diesel
and non-catalysed gasoline fueled cars), as is part of PM10.
These results suggest that the association of air pollution with
cardiovascular hospital admissions is primarily attributable to
traffic exhaust. The stronger confounding by NO2 than by CO,
suggests that diesel exhaust is primarily responsible. This
conclusion is also supported by the finding that BS, which is
dominated by diesel particles, is little affected by control for
CO or PM10 and less affected by control for NO2 in our analysis.
In contrast, the coefficient of PM10 after controlling for BS is
close to zero, suggesting that particles from non-traffic (and
primarily non-diesel) sources are not involved in the
association.
Further support for a role of diesel exhaust comes from the
negative slope in the meta regression of the PM10 coefficient
against mean ozone concentration. Ozone is formed by photochemical processes, which also result in the formation of sec-

ondary particles. Hence, higher ozone towns tend to have
higher levels of secondary particles. The finding of higher PM10
slope in towns where there are fewer secondary particles also
suggests diesel exhaust. A recent report supports this finding.
A recent analysis using factor analysis of daily measurements
of the elemental composition of particles has reported that
traffic derived particles are more associated with cardiovascular mortality and sulphate particles with respiratory
mortality.28 Another recent US study compared the effect estimates for PM10 on cardiac hospital admissions in 14 US cities
to data on the composition of the particles in those cites.29
Janssen and coworkers found that the percentage of particles
from traffic was a strong predictor of the PM10 effect, with
substantially larger effects in town with a greater proportion
of diesel and traffic particles.
We found little evidence of an impact of particles on hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease in people below 65
years or stroke for people over 65 years. Burnett 30 also found a
weak association between air pollution and hospitalisation for
cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases.
Particles seem to be the pollutant for which recent biological studies indicate a possible causal effect. Recent findings
tend to relate particulate pollution to an increased plasma
viscosity,31 increased risks of raised heart rate,32 electrocardiographic changes in dogs 33 and humans,34–36 and the triggering
of myocardial infarction.37 Concentrated human exposure to
concentrated air particles has also been associated with
increase in plasma fibrinogen.38 Epidemiological associations
have been reported between plasma fibrinogen and both particles and NO2.39 40 Particles and NO2 have also been associated
with the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and ventricular
tachycardia in patients with implanted cardioverter
defibrillators.41 These studies suggest that particles have an
effect on the physiology of cardiovascular system, but none of
these studies clearly points to a possible effect on stroke for
which we did not find any consistent result. Several studies
have indicated that the smaller particles, those less than 2.5
µm, are mainly responsible for these effects. Watkinson 42
shows that rodents exposed to fugitive oil fly ash particles
present an increase in the incidence and duration of serious
arrhythmic events.
We must acknowledge several limitations to our analysis.
The analysis of PM10 effects was hindered by the different
measurement methods that were used. Italian cities (Milan
and Rome) provided TSP and Paris PM13 instead of PM10. Combining results using these different measurements in a metaanalysis may increase heterogeneity, and consequently, add
noise to the overall estimate.
When we found significant heterogeneity between local
estimates, we performed an univariate metaregression. We
found that cardiac admissions (all ages) and ischaemic heart
disease admissions for people over 65 years were heterogeneous in regard to PM10 effect. Hospital admissions for cardiac
causes (all ages and for people over 65 years) were also
heterogeneous regarding a BS effect. We found a greater risk
for people over 65 years than for people below 65 years. This
finding was confirmed by the fact that heterogeneity in the
effect of PM10 on cardiac admissions for all ages was explained,
in part, by the proportion of cardiac admissions for people over
65 years on all ages. We did not find any evidence that meteorological conditions were modifying particle results. Regarding the health status of the population, we only found a negative relation between standardised lung cancer death and PM10
estimates for ischaemic heart disease admissions for people
over 65 years. The meaning of this association is not clear, and
need to be confirmed in future research.
If we examine figure 4, which expresses the percentage
increase for 10 µg/m3 of PM10 on ischaemic heart disease for
people over 65 years, ranged by at the annual mean level of O3,
we can see the fragility of the relation. Removing one city can
lead to a different effect of the mean O3 concentration on local

Association of particulate air pollution and cardiovascular diseases

estimates, either positive or negative. As these univariate
metaregressions were performed in eight cities, the inclusion
or exclusion of one city may lead to non-negligible changes in
results. This issue is going to be investigated with a large pool
of cities, in the framework of APHEA2-NMMAPS collaboration.
This study brings new evidence on the effects of particles on
cardiac diseases and points out the specific role of diesel
exhaust in Europe. Although the most consistent results were
for BS, and not for PM10, globally our results are in the same
range that those already published in the US, and consistent
with recent US studies suggesting a greater role for traffic
exhaust particles in exacerbating heart disease.
